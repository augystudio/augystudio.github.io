Hi, I'm Augy. 

I'm 28 years old, I've been writing forever, and making music for yeears. I used to think I couldn't sing, but I still did and then I kinda found my style. It turned out people loved my voice and my songs :O Those few who had a chance to hear it. 
Recently I've also started on youtube!
I like making visuals as well: sketches, paintings. I think some of them are quite good. 

I heal when I put my mind to something.
I am inspired by people who are brave enough to be vulnerable and raw. Not giving a f* about opinions, they're doing their thing. 


My favourite artist is Lana Del Rey, and my favourite band Alice In Chains.
